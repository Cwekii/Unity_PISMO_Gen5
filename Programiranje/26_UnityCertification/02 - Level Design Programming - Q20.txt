A Programmer is working on a simple 2D game for mobile and wants to ensure that the game runs fast and is optimized for mobile devices.
 
 What should the Programmer do to optimize for the mobile platforms? (Choose two.)



Answers: 
1. Use Object Pooling. 
2. Use RigidBodies limited to 2 dimensions. 
3. Make sure that all objects are destroyed when out of sight and only instanced as they need to be. 
4. Make use of OnGui() for the HUD. 
5. Write a custom physics system for the game. 



Correct Answers: 
1. Use Object Pooling. 
5. Write a custom physics system for the game. 



Explanation: 
Explanation The Programmer should write a custom physics system for the game. While it is more complicated and limited, it will be much faster than the Unity Physics system providing it is a simple game. The Programmer should also use Object Pooling. Instantiate and Destroy are process-intensive methods, and Object Pooling will dramatically improve performance. The Programmer should not Use RigidBodies limited to 2 dimensions. This is a waste of resources and the reason for the RigidBody2D component. The Programmer should not make sure that all objects are destroyed when out of sight. Instantiate and Destroy are process-intensive, so Object Pooling is recommended. The Programmer should not use OnGui() for the HUD or HUD elements. Canvas elements are much better for HUDs and performance. References Scripting and Gameplay Methods
