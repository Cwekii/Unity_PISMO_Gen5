A Programmer is working on a 3rd-person space shooter game for PC and must implement shooting missiles from the ship (player).
 
 The variable "missilePrefab" will be set in the inspector, and the prefab has been built so that the missile model properly faces forward on the local Z axis. The code will be in a script that is attached to the ship game object.
 
 Which code should the Programmer use to ensure that the missile fires forward from the player's ship?



Answers: 
1. FireMissile() { Instantiate(rocket, transform.position, rotation); } 
2. FireMissile() { Instantiate(missilePrefab, rotation.position, transform.rotation); } 
3. FireMissile() { Instantiate(missilePrefab, transform.position, Quaternion.identity); } 
4. FireMissile() { Instantiate(missilePrefab, transform.position, transform.rotation); } 



Correct Answers: 
4. FireMissile() { Instantiate(missilePrefab, transform.position, transform.rotation); } 



Explanation: 
Explanation The Programmer should use the following code: FireMissile() { Instantiate(missilePrefab, transform.position, transform.rotation); } Because the code is in a script attached to the player game object, the transform.position and transform.rotation are the ship's position and rotation. The Programmer should not use the following code: FireMissile() { Instantiate(rocket, transform.position, rotation); } The issue here is that rotation is unknown. You should use transform.rotation to pass the right data to the Instantiate method. The Programmer should not use the following code: FireMissile() { Instantiate(missilePrefab, rotation.position, transform.rotation); } The issue here is that rotation.position is unknown. You should use transform.rotation to pass the right data to the Instantiate method. The Programmer should not use the following code: FireMissile() { Instantiate(missilePrefab, transform.position, Quaternion.identity); } The issue here is that Quaternion.identity is the world's rotation, not the player's ship.
