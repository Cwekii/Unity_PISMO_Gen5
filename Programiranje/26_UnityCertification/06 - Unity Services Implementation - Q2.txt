A Programmer needs to add some simple Unity Ads to an existing mobile game. The Designer specified that under no circumstances should the ads have a negative impact on the players, but ads can reward the player with extra ammunition for watching the ads to the end.

What two things should the Programmer ensure? (Choose two.)


Answers: 
1. Ads are offered all the time. 
2. Ads are skippable. 
3. Ads provide a reward for watching the entire ad only. 
4. Ads are opt-out only. 



Correct Answers: 
2. Ads are skippable. 
3. Ads provide a reward for watching the entire ad only. 



Explanation: 
Explanation The Programmer should ensure that simple Unity Ads are always skippable. Forcing a player to watch ads with no way to skip them creates a negative impact on the gameplay experience and the players. The Programmer should ensure that a reward is only provided if the ad is watched in its entirety. Allowing a reward for not watching the whole ad diminishes the credibility of the game. The Programmer should not make ads opt-out. Forcing players to watch ads or opt out will have a negative impact on players. The Programmer should ensure that simple Unity Ads are opt-in only. The Programmer should not offer ads that reward the player all the time. Offering ads that provide a reward all of the time can create an imbalance or advantage in the gameplay.
