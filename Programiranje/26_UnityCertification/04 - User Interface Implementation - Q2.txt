A Programmer wants to convert the position of viewport space into screen space.
 
 Which method should the Programmer use?



Answers: 
1. RectTransform 
2. RectMask2D 
3. ScreenToViewportPoint() 
4. ViewportToScreenPoint() 



Correct Answers: 
4. ViewportToScreenPoint() 



Explanation: 
Explanation The Programmer should use ViewportToScreenPoint(), which correctly transforms a Vector3 from ViewportSpace into ScreenSpace. The Programmer should not use ScreenToViewportPoint(). It does the opposite of what the Programmer is after. It transforms a Vector3 from ScreenSpace into ViewportSpace. The Programmer should not use the RectTransform. It is a component attached to a Game Object and not a method. The Programmer should not use a RectMask2D. It is a masking control, not a method.
