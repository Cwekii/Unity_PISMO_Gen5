A Programmer is building a 3D, third person, open-world adventure game. The Programmer is asked to ensure that the player never has to wait for a scene to load.

The Programmer decides that the best approach for this will be to load and unload environment scenes when the player walks around and divides the environment up into a grid. All environment scenes adjacent (diagonally and orthogonally) to the player need to be loaded or loading in a way that produces a nine-square grid of loaded scenes at all times. (See the exhibit.)

The memory budget for all of these scenes is 855 MB.

What is the maximum size each environment scene can be, rounded up to the nearest MB?

Correct Answers: 



Explanation: 
Explanation If the memory budget for all nine of the scenes is 855 MB, each scene needs to be no larger than 95 MB (95 * 9 = 855). References LoadSceneMode.Additive SceneManager.LoadScene
