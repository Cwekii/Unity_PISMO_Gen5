A Programmer needs to spawn exactly 12 non-player characters (NPCs) into a level.
 
 There are four different spawn points. The Programmer wants to spawn the same number of enemies at each of the locations.
 
 Each of the spawn points is contained in an array of Vector3s named m_spawnPoints.
 
 The NPC prefab is set in the inspector and stored in the variable m_enemyPrefab. 
 
 Which code block should the Programmer use?



Answers: 
1. for(int sp = 0; sp < 4; sp++) { for (int e = 0; e < 3; e++) { Instantiate(m_enemyPrefab, m_spawnPoints[sp], Quaternion.Identity); } } 
2. for(int sp = 0; sp < 4; sp++) { for (int e = 0; e < 3; e++) { Instantiate(m_enemyPrefab, m_spawnPoints[e], Quaternion.Identity); } } 
3. for(int sp = 0; sp < 3; sp++) { for (int e = 0; e < 4; e++) { Instantiate(m_enemyPrefab, m_spawnPoints[sp], Quaternion.Identity); } } 
4. for(int sp = 0; sp < 4; sp++) { for (int e = 0; e < 3; sp++) { Instantiate(m_enemyPrefab, m_spawnPoints[sp], Quaternion.Identity); } } 



Correct Answers: 
1. for(int sp = 0; sp < 4; sp++) { for (int e = 0; e < 3; e++) { Instantiate(m_enemyPrefab, m_spawnPoints[sp], Quaternion.Identity); } } 



Explanation: 
Explanation The programmer should use the following code block: for(int sp = 0; sp < 4; sp++) { for (int e = 0; e < 3; e++) { Instantiate(m_enemyPrefab, m_spawnPoints[sp], Quaternion.Identity); } } This will correctly spawn three NPCs at each of the four spawn points. The programmer should not use the following code block: for(int sp = 0; sp < 3; sp++) { for (int e = 0; e < 4; e++) { Instantiate(m_enemyPrefab, m_spawnPoints[sp], Quaternion.Identity); } } This will spawn four NPCs at the first three spawn points and none at the last spawn point. The Programmer should not use the following code block: for(int sp = 0; sp < 4; sp++) { for (int e = 0; e < 3; e++) { Instantiate(m_enemyPrefab, m_spawnPoints[e], Quaternion.Identity); } } This will also spawn four NPCs at the first three spawn points and none at the last spawn point. The Programmer should not use the following code block: for(int sp = 0; sp < 4; sp++) { for (int e = 0; e < 3; sp++) { Instantiate(m_enemyPrefab, m_spawnPoints[sp], Quaternion.Identity); } } This will cause an index out of bounds error on the m_spawnPoints array.
